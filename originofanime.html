            <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
            <p>The history of Japanese animation can be traced back to the early 1900s, when Japanese filmmakers began experimenting with animation techniques that were being developed in France, Germany, and the United States.</p>
            <p>While examples of animated films existed in Japan before 1917, many film historians consider "Namakura Gatana" (The Blunt Sword) by Jun'ichi Kōuchi to be the oldest surviving Japanese animated short. This three-minute silent film depicted a samurai attempting to test a new sword, only to be defeated by his target.</p>

            <h2>The Tezuka Revolution</h2>
            <p>The most significant turning point in anime's history came with the emergence of Osamu Tezuka, often referred to as the "God of Manga."

            <p>His groundbreaking manga series "Astro Boy" (Tetsuwan Atom) was adapted into the first regularly broadcast anime TV series in 1963. This marked the birth of the anime industry as we know it today, with Tezuka introducing several cost-saving animation techniques that would become industry standards.</p>
